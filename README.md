# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This project is about visualization of different graph algorithms. This is achieved by visual representation of vertices and edges of the graph at different points of time during the execution of algorithms.
<br />

## Goal

Most people face difficulty when they start learning graph theory and related algorithms and this is mainly because of the fact that they do not get a feel of how exactly the algorithm is working. So, the major goal of this project is to help them as people have natural tendency to learn by seeing and interacting. We want to achieve this goal collaboratively, so feel free to contribute.

## Setting up the project locally

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork using 
```posh
git clone https://github.com/ChauhdryAhmad/Graph-Algorithm-Visualizer.git

3. Move into the new `algo-visualizer` directory using
```posh
cd algo-visualizer
```
4. Install the dependencies using
```posh
yarn
```
5. To start the development server, use
```posh
yarn start
```
